<span style="font-size:1.25rem;">
<span style="font-size:3rem;">COVID19</span> has not only shortened my dreamy 6-month long study abroad program in Sweden but also caused my internship at a reputable bank to be canceled. As Parkinson's Second Law puts it, "work expands to fill the time available for its completion". I had to do something about it to make my time productive. I never had the opportunity to explore Web technologies outside of my Academic Work in NUS. Therefore this was a good opportunity to explore the field of Web Development.

Skills developed over quarantine so far (2 months):

* OANDA RESTV20 (Python)
    * I developed a python script that could be run over an AWS EC2 cloud server to execute my trading strategy algorithmically using OANDA's API.
* AWS Cloud computing
    * Learned the basics of AWS and Linux commands to perform simple cloud computations  
* HTML, CSS, Jquery
    * Learned the basics of some front-end technologies
* Tensorflow
    * Used TensorFlow to develop an ML solution for SHOPEE Code League
    * Learned data-cleaning and model-optimisation techniques
* Programming Interview questions
    *  Practiced 20+ medium questions on LeetCode 

To-Do next month (1 month):

* Backend Technologies (PHP, Ruby)
* Database Management (SQL)
* More front end (ReactJS)
* 20 medium questions on Leetcode
* Execute and record trading algorithm on the live server
* Post a blog post every 2/3 days (English)

I will commit myself to the above tasks and continue to update them on this blog! Aligned with my learning goals from July to Mid August, I intend to start a marketplace business from scratch as part of a new personal project to **potentially build an income stream** and **practice the full spectrum of web development** from front-end to back-end. It will be a long road to take (cover page) but every marathon starts with a step and this is the first step I'm taking!

 So why the post title? From "7 Habits of effective people" by Dr. Stephen R. Covey, the second habit that he proposes was to seek clarity and vision in our lives. To do so, I'm making the conscious effort to visualise the end goal of this summer break and commit to those goals. My long term goal for this page is to continuously update my progress, share small programming snippets and reflections on my everyday life.
