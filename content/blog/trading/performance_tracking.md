Greetings fellow traders,

We achieved a 100% win rate with three winning trades, and we're up 4.5% in just three days. This Flush Algo took me close to 1 month to backtest and develop and I'm glad it's showing good potential! I will be updating the Algo's performance in this google spreadsheet: https://bit.ly/2ZBIAQv

 It's looking pretty good being up 4.5%, but it's hard to tell it's long-term performance with a sample size of 3 trades. I will be conducting further portfolio analysis on this strategy when I collect more data in the future for sure! If anyone is interested in trading algorithmically with OANDA's API or would like me to automate your trading strategy, feel free to reach out to me and I'll be more than happy to help.

Peace
