Greetings fellow traders, 

Time for a mid-month update of the flush algo-trader. Over the past 2 weeks, we achieved an ROI of <span style="font-size:1.5rem;font-weight: bold;">6.19%</span> with a total of 11 trades. Once again, if anyone is keen to follow the progress of this script: https://bit.ly/2ZBIAQv

If you have noticed I have been trading exclusively on Brent Crude Oil the past 2 weeks and this is because the backtests I have performed showed that this strategy works exceptionally well on this derivative. It also works well when prices are relatively stable on the daily charts which is true for crude oil currently. The upwards pressure of Gold from the falling US Dollar and money rushing to safe assets in this Covid times signal a strong uptrend in Gold which may not be favourable for this strategy.

P.S: I've been thinking of sending my trade commands to a telegram bot for folks who wish to copy my automated trades. I might do it as a side project, if anyone if interested in that idea drop me a pm :)
