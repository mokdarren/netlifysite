This entry will mark the start of running a live algorithm on OANDA, I will document it's performance weekly on this blog to determine it's profitability. I call this strategy the Flush strategy, and it makes trades when a significant move is felt in the market. After performing backtests on 2 years of past data, I found this strategy to be highly profitable on volatile markets such as Crude Oil and Gold. Therefore this script will only be performed on the following trading pairs:

<br></br>
__Pairs__:
* BCO_USD
* WTI_USD
* XAU_USD

__Targets__:
* A monthly increase of 5%
* Maximum drawdown of 30%

Start: $850SGD </br>
